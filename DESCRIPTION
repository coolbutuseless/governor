Description: Speed limiter for controlling rate of execution of loops.   It 
    can be necessary to limit the rate of execution of a loop or repeated function
    call e.g. to show or gather data only at particular intervals.
    This package includes two methods for limiting this execution rate; speed governors
    and timers.  A speed governor will insert pauses during execution to meet
    a user-specified loop time.  Timers are alarm clocks which will indicate 
    whether a certain has passed.  These mechanisms are implemented in 'C'
    to minimize processing overhead.
